Nemotec Dental Studio NX has been proven to be a reliable and valid software suite for predicting the outcome of orthognathic surgery. A study by StefanoviÄ et al. (2011) found that computerized cephalometric predictions for hard-tissue structures in the sagittal and vertical planes, as well as the VTO parameters, generated using the Nemotec Dental Studio NX 2005 software were accurate, while lower lip and mentolabial sulcus position predictions were not reliable enough[^1^]. The authors suggested that further improvements in soft-tissue prediction algorithms are needed to enhance the software's performance[^1^].
